/**
 * Retrieves a Universal Bridge quote for the provided buy intent. The quote will specify the necessary `originAmount` to receive the desired `destinationAmount`, which is specified with the `buyAmountWei` option.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";
 *
 * const quote = await Bridge.Buy.quote({
 *   originChainId: 1,
 *   originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
 *   destinationChainId: 10,
 *   destinationTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
 *   amount: toWei("0.01"),
 *   client: thirdwebClient,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * This will return a quote that might look like:
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   originAmount: 10000026098875381n,
 *   destinationAmount: 1000000000000000000n,
 *   blockNumber: 22026509n,
 *   timestamp: 1741730936680,
 *   estimatedExecutionTimeMs: 1000
 *   steps: [
 *     {
 *       originToken: {
 *         chainId: 1,
 *         address: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
 *         symbol: "ETH",
 *         name: "Ethereum",
 *         decimals: 18,
 *         priceUsd: 0.0025,
 *         iconUri: "https://..."
 *       },
 *       destinationToken: {
 *         chainId: 10,
 *         address: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
 *         symbol: "ETH",
 *         name: "Ethereum",
 *         decimals: 18,
 *         priceUsd: 0.0025,
 *         iconUri: "https://..."
 *       },
 *       originAmount: 10000026098875381n,
 *       destinationAmount: 1000000000000000000n,
 *       estimatedExecutionTimeMs: 1000
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   intent: {
 *     originChainId: 1,
 *     originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
 *     destinationChainId: 10,
 *     destinationTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
 *     amount: 1000000000000000000n
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The quote is an **estimate** for how much you would expect to pay for a specific buy. This quote is not guaranteed and you should use `Buy.prepare` to get a finalized quote with transaction data ready for execution.
 * So why use `quote`? The quote function is sometimes slightly faster than `prepare`, and can be used before the user connects their wallet.
 *
 * You can access this functions input and output types with `Buy.quote.Options` and `Buy.quote.Result`, respectively.
 *
 * @param options - The options for the quote.
 * @param options.originChainId - The chain ID of the origin token.
 * @param options.originTokenAddress - The address of the origin token.
 * @param options.destinationChainId - The chain ID of the destination token.
 * @param options.destinationTokenAddress - The address of the destination token.
 * @param options.amount - The amount of the destination token to receive.
 * @param options.client - Your thirdweb client.
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a non-finalized quote for the requested buy.
 *
 * @throws Will throw an error if there is an issue fetching the quote.

 * ## Sending the transactions
 * The `transactions` array is a series of [ox](https://oxlib.sh) EIP-1559 transactions that must be executed one after the other in order to fulfill the complete route. There are a few things to keep in mind when executing these transactions:
 *  - Approvals will have the `approval` action specified. You can perform approvals with `sendAndConfirmTransaction`, then proceed to the next transaction.
 *  - All transactions are assumed to be executed by the `sender` address, regardless of which chain they are on. The final transaction will use the `receiver` as the recipient address.
 *  - If an `expiration` timestamp is provided, all transactions must be executed before that time to guarantee successful execution at the specified price.
 *
 * NOTE: To get the status of each non-approval transaction, use `Bridge.status` rather than checking for transaction inclusion. This function will ensure full bridge completion on the destination chain.
 *
 * You can access this functions input and output types with `Buy.prepare.Options` and `Buy.prepare.Result`, respectively.
 *
 * @param options - The options for the quote.
 * @param options.originChainId - The chain ID of the origin token.
 * @param options.originTokenAddress - The address of the origin token.
 * @param options.destinationChainId - The chain ID of the destination token.
 * @param options.destinationTokenAddress - The address of the destination token.
 * @param options.amount - The amount of the destination token to receive.
 * @param options.sender - The address of the sender.
 * @param options.receiver - The address of the recipient.
 * @param options.purchaseData - Arbitrary data to be passed to the purchase function and included with any webhooks or status calls.
 * @param options.client - Your thirdweb client.
