/**
 * Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.
 * Also referred to as %R, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high for the look-back period.
 * In contrast, the Stochastic Oscillator reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low.
 * %R corrects for the inversion by multiplying the raw value by -100. As a result,
 * the Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R produce the exact same lines,
 * but with different scaling. Williams %R oscillates from 0 to -100; readings from 0 to -20 are considered overbought,
 * while readings from -80 to -100 are considered oversold. Unsurprisingly,
 * signals derived from the Stochastic Oscillator are also applicable to Williams %R.
