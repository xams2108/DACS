/**
 * Developed by Marc Chaikin, the Chaikin Oscillator measures the momentum of the Accumulation Distribution Line
 * using the MACD formula. (This makes it an indicator of an indicator.) The Chaikin Oscillator
 * is the difference between the 3-day and 10-day EMAs of the Accumulation Distribution Line.
 * Like other momentum indicators, this indicator is designed to anticipate directional changes
 * in the Accumulation Distribution Line by measuring the momentum behind the movements.
 * A momentum change is the first step to a trend change.
 * Anticipating trend changes in the Accumulation Distribution Line can help chartists anticipate
 * trend changes in the underlying security. The Chaikin Oscillator generates signals with
 * crosses above/below the zero line or with bullish/bearish divergences.
