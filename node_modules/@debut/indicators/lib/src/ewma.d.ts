/**
 * The Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) is a quantitative or statistical measure used to model or describe
 * a time series. The EWMA is widely used in finance, the main applications being technical analysis and volatility modeling.
 * The moving average is designed as such that older observations are given lower weights.
 * The weights fall exponentially as the data point gets older â€“ hence the name exponentially weighted.
 * The only decision a user of the EWMA must make is the parameter alpha.
 * The parameter decides how important the current observation is in the calculation of the EWMA.
 * The higher the value of alpha, the more closely the EWMA tracks the original time series.
 * @param alpha must be from 0 to 1
